Added function to push todo to DOM and adjust date formatting with date-fns

This commit adds a new function called `displayTodo` to the UI module that creates a new todo element and displays it in the main window. The function also uses the `format` function from date-fns to adjust the date format to "Wed 30 Apr" before displaying it.

Additionally, this commit updates the necessary files to import and use the `displayTodo` function in the appropriate places.
