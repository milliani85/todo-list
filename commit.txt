Add a basic form to create a todo and toggle form display

Added a basic form for creating a new todo item. The form includes necessary fields such as title, description, and due date. Additionally, a button has been added to the navigation bar that toggles the display of the form, allowing users to show or hide the form as needed.

This commit introduces the initial setup and UI components for creating todos and provides the ability to control the visibility of the form.
