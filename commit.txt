Added functionality to display all projects in a list on the side nav
- Created a new function, displayAllProjects, that iterates through the projects array and adds each project to the side nav as a list item.
- Updated the displayProject function to add projects to the side nav list.

Added function to populate project select dropdown in the todo form
- Modified the displayAllProjects function to also populate the project select dropdown in the todo form with all created projects.
- Each project is added as an option element with the project title as both the value and the displayed text.
This enhances the user interface by providing a visual representation of all created projects in the side nav and allows users to select a project from the dropdown when creating a new todo.
