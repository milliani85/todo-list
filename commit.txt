Add removeTodo function to remove a todo from the todos array and display

This commit introduces the removeTodo function, which allows removing a todo from the todos array and also removes it from the display. The function performs the following tasks:

- Removes the todo from the todos array by finding its index using `indexOf` and splicing it using `splice`.
- Removes the todo from the display by removing its corresponding DOM element using the `remove` method.

The removeTodo function provides a convenient way to delete todos from the application, ensuring consistency between the todos array and the user interface.
